# Machinedramon-Alpha

An old Discord bot meant to be used in a server to help promote the organization of a collection of Digimon TCG cards and facilitate trading.
Ended up only being used in a test server, a better alternative opened (Cardmarket website) so it went unused.
Not up to date with Discord's new nickname API (and possibly other stuff, but thought it wouldn't harm to put this here).
